In the field next to the port, they were given away as slaves to the local noblemen and merchants. For the next 400 years, more than six million Africans would be trafficked in Portuguese ships to Europe and across the Atlantic.\r\nIn a rainy winter afternoon in 2009, in Lagos, archeologists excavating the site where an underground parking was under construction, began to find human skeletons. Working on the site for the following five months, as the parking was being built around them, the archeologists uncovered the skeletons of 158 enslaved African men, women, and children. Their bodies had been dumped in a XV-century landfill.\r\nIntertwining these two storylines, Tales of Oblivion threads tales of violence and brutality from the past with sights and sounds of the present. Evoking what took place in these sites and conjuring memories from the past, Tales of Oblivion is a film- territory where we have no choice but to look at how the present continues to be shaped by the history we carry within us.",

The absurdity is heightened by the fact that Visser regularly intervenes in the film to chat with the designer, giving instructions to change fonts or to zoom in on photos.\r\n\r\nAlreadymade is a search for the truth behind \u201cFountain,\u201d a reflection on what makes art into art, and at the same time an attempt to bring Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven to life. Using the little archive footage of her that exists, and with the help of a German actress and modern technology, the fascinating bohemian is brought out of the margins of art history.",

Her days are filled with the blunt murmur of discontent, promises of better working conditions that have lost all credibility in their emptiness, and refreshing puffs of smoke secretly shared with the neighbouring house's servant Gisela. The impeccably inconspicuous everyday life of Ana is increasingly ignited by the sampling of the lavishly rich lifestyle that surrounds her. The first taste of luxury, status, and power is so exhilarating that getting caught is only a matter of time. In a few days, the seemingly ordinary villa turns into a rabbit hole and from its depths, Ana finds the courage to create chaos instead of order.

    "synopsis": "Khuzestan, in southwestern Iran, is a landscape etched with scars. Amassed over its history of colonization, industrialization, revolution, and war, they define a place steeped in its past. Through the lens of workers, Meezan examines the memory of an Iranian province where conflict and war, especially in connection with oil, have left their mark. In three parts, manual labourers with maritime-related tasks and professions come together to build a polyphony of movements, sounds, and colours to create a sensory conversation that questions the bodily experience of a population who lives in a place charged with a history that defines it despite itself.",

Wartime justice in the first world conflict is a theme that is often underestimated in regards to its dimension and its cruelty. Italy, in particular, holds the sad record for the ferocity with which it punished its soldiers: the many that deserted, those that rebelled against the trenches, against the suicide attacks imposed by the commands, or that simply displayed an insufficient \u201cpatriotic spirit\u201d for a cause that they felt didn\u2019t belong to them.\r\nIn Italy, from 1915 to 1918, 1 soldier out of 14 undergoes a criminal trial, 1 out of 24 is tried for desertion. This is the theme that the documentary film \u201cthe Disobedients of the war\u201d wants to bring to light: the massacres of the cursory executions, the decimations, the abnormality of the punishments. During this time of celebrating the War, this film offers to tell stories of men that were against it.",

This is the first feature film by IWASAKI Kanshi, who studied directing under MANDA Kunitoshi at THE FILM SCHOOL OF TOKYO and has worked as an assistant director and sound recordist on films by MIYAZAKI Daisuke and KIYOHARA Yui. The subtle camerawork and attention to sound are superb, but what is most impressive is the lead actress MURAKAMI Yukino who plays Koto - her presence supports the backbone of the story that does not have any special incidents. Although the film depicts an everyday domestic world around us, it is interesting to see a glimpse of Japanese society through Koto's work.",

A brilliant jack-of-all-trades whose eccentric talent convinced the creative elite of international pop music to entrust him with his music videos (Bjo\u0308rk, the Rolling Stones, Daft Punk, The White Stripes, Beck, etc.) before allowing him to chart his own course in Hollywood\u2014without ever renouncing his rather crazy style\u2014and to become one of the rare Oscar-winning French filmmakers (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind). From hand to eye, Michel Gondry has been offering us for thirty years to seize what surrounds us to create and tell the world. A work that is a constant praise of wonder through craftsmanship: whether we approach his relationship to music and his beginnings as a videographer; the notion of magic inherent in his conception of the image; its roots in childhood and the world of dreams; the paradox of his Hollywood career; and the humanist ambition of its craftsmanship... which is also a political act. Do it yourself.",

With the help of his best friend Rinus, he grows potatoes, beetroot, grain, and strawberries, which he sells from his barn. In between these activities, his farmhouse proves to be a gathering spot for neighbors and friends, who share with him their dry wit and simple joy. Meanwhile, the outside world imposes itself more and more blatantly, in the form of money-hungry entrepreneurs, the municipal government, aircraft noise, the neighboring McDonald\u2019s and a failed harvest due to climate change. But Gerlach doggedly continues: with the help of his brothers, he conducts lawsuits\u2013with occasional success\u2013and sows new crops.\r\nAliona van der Horst and Luuk Bouwman portray the unflappable, stooped-over farmer with the same dedication and love with which he works his land, sometimes in close-up, sometimes in beautifully composed shots of the shadow he casts on his beloved field.\"\r\n(IDFA - International Documentary Festival Amsterdam)",

    "synopsis": "An embarrassing problem emerges in a quiet household somewhere in a province of Sri Lanka. The patriarch of a lovely family suddenly dies in front of the TV one fateful night. He experienced something soulfully romantic before his last breath and the most sensitive part of his deceased body still functions without pulse or blood pressure. His two grown sons and a mourning mother are eager to bend down the standing organ to avoid shameful reactions at the funeral. Brothers don\u2019t mention the painful loss until evening but rumours, suspicion, jealousy, and blackmailing spread fast. Nosy neighbour Kamala is eminently curious. She could see the last mistress-like lady, who visited their father. A local doctor has never witnessed such a riveting lustful diagnosis. Infamous drunken voodooist and chief monk are unable to find alternative solutions. Another step is to make a deal with the coffin maker and chant a mantra. Will brothers have enough time to solve the most unusual farcical task before father's departure to heaven?",

As a benchmark for politically correct choices, Delphine no longer needs to do anything other than teach others and talk about how a tolerant society starts from home. A splendidly idyllic holiday with the family by the pool while enjoying cocktails turns sour when a woman who wishes to remain anonymous wants to say something to Delphine. The absurd babble of a stranger on the phone about a possible secret relationship between Antoine and their adoptee does not deserve any undue attention in Delphine's eyes. But doubt never leaves until the truth comes out. And now Delphine's wandering gaze can only notice what does not exist.",

The film focuses on Martha and Diego, a married couple who have been appointed guardians of the saint, and on Rom\u00e1n and his son Tino, who have been called upon to serve as musicians. Music has a key role to play in this blend of Catholic and Mayan faith. Meticulously and with love, filmmaker Humberto G\u00f3mez P\u00e9rez - son of Martha and Diego - captures the dedication with which these servants of faith execute their allotted tasks. Elsewhere in the film, the director treats the viewer to stunning views of the sweeping mountain landscape and close-ups of the crafted objects and musical instruments that have a central role in this religious practice. He transports us from the everyday to the divine, and from the personal to the collective, to witness still-thriving ancient approaches to transferring knowledge.",

A journey of the soul, which relies on images from Zucchero\u2019s private archive and the \u201cWorld Wild Tour\u201d, his last triumphant world tour, to reach beyond the portrait of a successful musician and delve into the doubts and fragilities of the man.",

In his homeland, however, his work reflecting everyday life, social reality or the meaning of language has never achieved comparable fame. Together with the children of an artist who was not afraid to confront the public with the question of the meaning of art, the director embarks on a journey that aims not only to get closer to Man\u010du\u0161ka, but also to reveal him in hitherto unrecognised shades, thus filling in the gaps that are increasingly appearing in the context of the fading memory of his personality.",

For this reason, she leaves Argentina, the land of her home, and travels to the West Bank, where her absent parent comes from. But at first she finds only more ruins, the remains of houses destroyed by the Israeli occupiers. As slowly as the calm sea ripples, the author's pilgrimage to her roots turns into an encounter with an entire nation that has been stripped of its home. The shared experience of loss helps her to fill the empty space in her heart.",

Still today, every gesture of the rice cycle \u2013 from plowing to harvesting \u2013 is haunted by memories of the war. A trauma that is also inscribed in their present-\r\nday rituals, bodies, landscapes, and techno music. In the war\u2019s aftermath, a group of soldiers got possessed by a messianic vision, \u201cThe Shadow\u201d, that gave them the power to foresee the future and heal their communities with bush plants through talismanic writings. FIRE IN THE MUD takes a deeply immersive approach to a complex melting pot of religious forms and political turmoil within a diverse community claiming their future in contemporary Guinea-Bissau.",

    "synopsis": "The film presents the invasion of Ukraine as a war of memory, identity and truth. Using live music performance, painting, street art, and the act of filmmaking itself, it aims to illuminate the psychological frontlines of the crisis: how to go to a restaurant or bar amid the near-constant blare of air-raid alarms and missile strikes; how to process, react, and resist, while having to go about the rhythms of daily life. Blurring the lines between what is seen in front of and behind the camera, the film probes what it means to make cinema in a time of war.",

Jones, Shakira and William Kentridge, Red Hot Chili Peppers among many others. Fuller developed a completely new kind of spectacle which combined dance, fabric and movement. It's about a woman who became famous on her own terms \u2013 unapologetic about her body type and open about her sexuality.",

    "synopsis": "1,941. That's how many photos of phone boxes Floriane Devigne has collected over the course of the eight years she worked on this film. The rarer they become, the harder she searches... She constructs her film like a collection, gathering, sorting and sharing her most memorable encounters and stories. She invites us along for the ride in this funny, political and inspired road movie through France's dead zones, as she mischievously pursues her obsession. As well as collecting photographs, Floriane also records the phone conversations she receives in the last phone boxes that remain standing, in remote areas where the 4G network has yet to penetrate. The opening scene of Allo la France sees the filmmaker taking a boat in order to reach the last phone box in Paris, which has been abandoned on a quay - presumably because it would be more complicated to remove it than to leave it there. This phone box imposes itself as a symbol of what is left of public utilities. From an accounting perspective, have the public utilities that are left in our ever-changing societies survived simply because it would be more expensive to remove them than to leave them where they are?",

    "synopsis": "Eight years ago, Shiv moved with his wife and young son from Nepal to Poland for a better life. Now in Warsaw, he makes a living by delivering food and by night as a taxi driver. At the same time, his teenage son goes to school and his wife sits at home unhappy. A time-lapse portrait of an immigrant family follows their seemingly ordinary life as well as interpersonal conflicts. Misunderstandings, old grievances and different values lead to the breakdown of family well-being and painful separation. The film sensitively portrays the problems faced by immigrants in Europe, and at the same time focuses attention on their individual life destinies, dreams and hopes.",

    "synopsis": "After more than 160 years of existence, one of the largest Croatian shipyards Uljanik is closing down. The place where ships of impressive size and importance were manufactured and then sailed away has been turned into an industrial graveyard for wrecks, dysfunctional cranes and abandoned workshops that once teemed with life. Through a collage of observational footage, however, we now observe the almost post-apocalyptic landscape of the site, which has become home to seagulls, sea creatures and hungry cats. How did Pula's originally important Austro-Hungarian shipping empire come to an end? The former glory of Uljanik and its road to extinction come alive in the memories of countless individuals, many of whom have dedicated their professional and private lives to Uljanik.",

For them, a house on four wheels remains the only economically affordable option. In this time-lapse documentary, we follow the lives of three women on a long journey across the United States as their lives have been transformed. How do they cope with radical change? And what do loved-ones and friends have to say about their decision? These questions are also answered in the film, which anchors the philosophy of desolation in a broader political and social context.",

The documentary, with the poetic diction of the author's haunting voice, chronicles her journey from the sands of Arabia to the icy Antarctic, where she participated in a popular-science expedition. It is the contrast of two worlds, two completely different places, that brings her to question the titular places of the soul. Where do our memories remain? Where do we really belong at home? And where do we keep those who have already left us?",

The local people called him the \u201cChinaman.\u201d\r\n\r\nLi Yuan-Chia invited more than 300 artists worldwide to exhibit in the L.Y.C. Museum. The exhibitions embody the art practice, which goes beyond the boundaries set by races, nationalities, and even social classes. He held the gesture as Sisyphus and was against the art market led by capitalism in western countries.\r\n\r\nThis documentary is unfolded in dialogues crossing time and space, and his legacy is justified by his diaries, recordings, works, and friendship. Directors have gradually turned to be witnesses of Li\u2019s lost time in the process of seeking, interpreting Li\u2019s life journey and art practice in the light of Laozi\u2019s dialectical idea of ALL AND NOTHING.",

    "synopsis": "Nguyen Quoc Phi was a young Vietnamese man who came to Taiwan with dreams of a better life. He worked at a construction site, saving up enough money to start his own business back in his home country. However, his dreams were shattered when he was accused of car theft and shot dead by the police under questionable circumstances. The public quickly labeled him as a criminal and drug user, but the truth was far more complex. In this investigative documentary, witness never-before-seen body-cam footage and in-depth interviews with Phi's family, friends, brokers, and police. The film uncovers the harsh reality of the migrant worker system between Southeast Asia and Taiwan. It sheds light on the discrimination and inequality faced by migrant workers who are brought to Taiwan to work in low-wage jobs. Through Phi's story, the film challenges us to question the systemic injustices that continue to plague our society. It provides a visceral and immersive experience that perfectly captures the hidden and cruel reality that migrant workers endure. It is told through Phi's personal diary, offers a unique perspective on the experiences of these workers, and sheds light on their struggles, hopes, and dreams. It also amplifies the voices of these workers, who are often silenced and marginalized in mainstream media. This is a powerful and thought-provoking film that reveals the urgent need for systemic change to ensure the rights and dignity of every human being are respected.",

    "synopsis": "Farhan, a director, and Tithi, an actress, are a married couple living in Dhaka. In the conservative and patriarchal Muslim society, they face criticism for not having kids even though they have been married for ten years. When her work slows down during the pandemic, Tithi wants to have a baby. She persuades Farhan and succeeds in getting pregnant. One day, near the end of her pregnancy, Tithi grows uneasy at the loud firecracker sounds that continue late into the night. Farhan ventures into the night to investigate. The film, which began as a romantic comedy, momentarily shifts to a thriller, and finally turns into the type of poignant social drama for which director Farooki is best known. Farooki and his wife and actor Tisha co-wrote the script, ensuring its realistic feel. The title, borrowed from Kurosawa Akira\u2019s memoir, is a bitter joke that questions the boundary between reality and fiction depicted in the film.",

While The Night Visitors is interested in moths as organisms, with fascinating life histories, staggering biodiversity, and a functional importance as indicators of climate change and habitat degradation, its engagement with them is not primarily entomological. Instead, the film looks at moths as aesthetic beings and as carriers of meaning, aiming for a deep encounter with the beauty and incommensurability of the profoundly other. \r\n\r\nThe small hours of the night are threaded through with a sense of mortality and loss. Moths, with their trembling and exquisite impermanence, provide both a kind of solace and, in their diversity and difference, a focal point around which the desire to know can be organized.",

Based on the autobiographical story of a former journalist and mother of a child with a disability, the film spans over a decade and reveals, through various anecdotes, the very real and concrete challenges that parents and families with disabled children face. In particular, it is when Ji-woo enters elementary school that the prejudicial stigma surrounding disability and the loopholes in the system officially come into play. It takes Sang-yeon a long time to accept the movie\u2019s message that \u201cdisability is not something to be cured but a way of life\u201d into her own life. This time taken will overlap and resonate with the time outside of the movie for a while, leaving us with long questions and a long aftermath.",

At the age of 18, Andreas has seen only  hardship but finds the courage to leave his oppressor. Though partly  crippled by his uncle, he has grown into a strong man and finds work  as a woodsman. He works on the construction of an invention: the  mountain ropeway. This invention marks the beginning of alpine  tourism but is paid for with the many deaths of mountain workers.  Andreas is no stranger to hard labour, and now that he is earning his  own money, he buys himself a small plot of land with a cabin high  up in the valley. He soon finds something he has never experienced  before: love. Marie immediately becomes the light of his life, but his  dream of a happy life together is soon shattered. Feeling despondent,  Andreas enlists as a soldier in the German Wehrmacht. Coming face  to face with death in the Russian Caucasus, he thinks only of Marie. \r\nHaving survived the madness of the second World War, Andreas  returns to the valley and to a changed world. With Marie always in his  heart, Andreas accepts and cherishes the time he has left with serenity.",

At the village fair the little girl clings to her papa and opens her eyes wide to make room for all the things that have appeared in front of her. Be they real or imagined, Zelinda has seen those things now and has got an idea of how the world turns. It turns so fast that her story becomes someone else\u2019s. In 1943 Assunta is a girl in the countryside who balances on one leg, with her head in the clouds and a foot in the war (another one!). But as soon as she can Assunta sews a colored dress for herself, takes a skip and all of a sudden the war has become a joke, or at least it\u2019s over. The war (perhaps!) is over, and with it a whole world disappears: that skip was bigger than it seemed. In 1978 Icaro is a little boy in the countryside whose life turns around nothing. He has to do and is going to do something that was dreamed-of many years earlier and was not possible for his mother and his grandmother. And for those who came before them. And before that. And even before that.",

Among the most popular have been images of Thomas Builds-the-Fire (Evan Adams) calling out \u201cHey, Victor!\u201d to Victor Joseph (Adam Beach) in a distinctive rez accent. In Hey, Viktor!, actor Cody Lightning, who played the child version of Beach\u2019s character, revisits that beloved film as director, co-writer, and \u2014 playing an outsized version of himself \u2014 mockumentary lead. Eager to boost his floundering acting career, the fictional Cody looks to cash in on his old childhood role. He wants to make a sequel for Smoke Signals, in which he would star (as \u201cViktor,\u201d to avoid a potential lawsuit), alongside the original cast. His first move: hijack the film crew which is documenting his intervention. This wild comedy follows a man with plenty of vices, driven by money and fame as he alienates his family and friends (such as his producer Kate, played by Hannah Cheesman) on his quest to make this sequel. Fans of the film\u2019s inspiration will have that nostalgic itch scratched \u2014 we may or may not see many of Smoke Signals\u2019 core cast \u2014 but there are so many outrageous moments and jokes that it\u2019s a fun ride to go on, even if you haven\u2019t seen the original. Hey, Viktor! is both a mockumentary \u2014 one that plays on the idea of fame and cultural capital \u2014 and, much like the film it\u2019s tapping into, a journey of self-discovery.",

It is striking how many people he sees who are obviously in love. It might have something to do with his older sister\u2019s behaviour, given that she\u2019s preoccupied with wedding preparations and is always humming love songs. Or is it his age? In any case, there\u2019s no one around Xiao Yang who, from his perspective at least, does much else other than flirt, break up old relationships and try to start new ones. That includes his parents. His mother runs a juice bar and noodle stand and spends far more of her day with the owner of the shop next door than with her accordion-playing husband. When his sister is dumped by her fianc\u00e9, Xiao Yang takes matters into his own hands, believing in true adolescent style that external forces can actually influence couple configurations. But this belief is really the only thing that distinguishes the teenager from his elders. TIAN MI MI is a film that belies the notion that is ever possible to be older than seventeen in matters of love.",

    "synopsis": "Nicknamed Achilles, Farid (Mirsaeed Molavian), a former filmmaker, now works nights as an orthotist in Iran\u2019s capital. Broken by the only political system his generation has ever known, he is consumed by anger and sorrow. One night, after a colleague\u2019s devastating revelation of losing her son and additionally suffering 26 days before authorities permitted his body to be claimed, Achilles\u2019s apathy begins to crumble. Meanwhile, the administration is cracking down on his lack of rule-following, which leads him to a hospital\u2019s restricted psychiatric ward. There, he meets a sedated patient, handcuffed to her bed: Hedieh (Behdokht Valian), a political prisoner who has been institutionalized for years. Now, with the help of Achilles, she will again experience freedom \u2014 which, as those who have lived without it know, is regained at a cost. The duo\u2019s only option is to flee. Shot on location, Achilles takes us from Tehran to the dried-up Lake Urmia in Iran\u2019s northwestern province of Shabestar, to the Caspian Sea, and, with authorities in hot pursuit, to Maku, near Turkey\u2019s border. Unbeknownst to Hedieh, who is estranged from her daughter, the journey is not entirely haphazard. Unbeknownst to Farid, his actions will ripple well beyond his own life. Writer-director Farhad Delaram developed this film as the bloody crackdown on protesters began in his home country, and he drew on his lived experience, having spent weeks in a small cell surrounded only by concrete. His feature debut is a testament to the magnitude of collective cracks that \u2014 when amassed \u2014 can tear down walls.",

The pair of them share practically everything: a little house on the river filled with memories, the small amount of money earned working for a local drug dealer, a passion for evenings of salsa and merengue. An existence on the margins lived with love, at once symbiotic and oppressive, whose precarious equilibrium risks being undermined with the arrival of Ines, a young Colombian who has just made her first journey as a cocaine \u201cmule.\u201d Between desire and jealousy the situation rapidly gets out of hand, to the point where Julio will find himself taking drastic measures, on a painful journey that will take him for the first time to the land of his origins.",

    "synopsis": "With a verit\u00e9 documentary feel, WHAT WE SEE draws from its filmmakers\u2019 lives to tell a powerful story of siblings doing their best to connect during the pandemic. Co-directed by Carol Kunnuk and Lucy Tulugarjuk, WHAT WE SEE presents a relationship between two sisters \u2014 one in Montreal and the other in Nunavut \u2014 who each deal with trauma in their own way. Set during the beginning of the global COVID-19 outbreak, the film is told almost entirely through video chats, revealing how isolating the lockdowns are for the sisters \u2014 also played by Kunnuk and Tulugarjuk, blurring fact and fiction \u2014 especially with the significant physical distance between them. As WHAT WE SEE unfolds, the contrast between the sisters\u2019 experiences begins to narrow. At first, we see extremely familiar scenes of each person speaking to their device\u2019s camera, alone from their home. But this begins to open up to communal settings. The elder sister Saqpinak (Kunnuk) is often surrounded by grandchildren and hosts a live-TV event with elders performing ajaajaa songs. The younger sister Uyarak (Tulugarjuk) is with her beautiful daughters in her Montreal apartment, and gets a traditional hand-poked tattoo. This connection between the sisters and their culture is also the impetus for opening up hard discussions about domestic and childhood sexual abuse. Uyarak has a lot of questions about an experience of childhood sexual abuse that has recently bubbled to the surface for her. Saqpinak, however, waits until they\u2019re finally reunited in Igloolik to share her own story.",

Both are confronted with the restrictive gender concepts of sports and are trying to free themselves out of them.

But that\u2019s okay since this is also a world where our hearts are removable objects that reflect our personalities, things we can dig out of our chests to make life less emotional. Insurance worker Anabel (Anna Maguire) refuses to be at the whim of technology. Messy, awkward and authentic, she doesn\u2019t fit in, creates art, and seeks out happiness. She\u2019s lonely but dismisses her bestie Casey\u2019s (Donna Benedicto) prodding to use the omniscient app for a date. As luck would have it, she has a chance meeting with George (Hamza Haq), a deadpan and direct man. Anabel can\u2019t get him out of her mind, and when she\u2019s rejected by him and devastated by some terrible news, she removes her heart and impetuously gives it to the unfeeling George to avoid further heartache. Shocked by the act, George escapes his overbearing mother, Mona (Veena Sood) and goes on an emotional odyssey with Anabel\u2019s heart, but will her missing heart really be the cure for her tumultuous life? Director Kim Albright\u2019s debut feature brings writer and playwright Julia Lederer\u2019s acclaimed play and audio drama to the big screen. Charming and darkly funny, they explore the literal act of wearing our hearts on our sleeves \u2014 or outside of the chest cavity \u2014 through magic realism. This surreal universe goes beyond that of Yorgos Lanthimos as Anabel and George navigate embracing their emotions in high-tech times, bringing a truly unique voice that Haq and Maguire capture beautifully. Far from a clich\u00e9, WITH LOVE AND A MAJOR ORGAN uses comedy and heartbreak to explore societal pressures through a most unique meet-cute fairy tale.",

We delve into this teenager's past, from his conception in the Paris of A Bout de Souffle, where his parents were working at the time, to his first forays into filmmaking. Fascinated by the already legendary filmmaker, Thomas dreams of becoming his assistant. He writes to JLG, asking him if he could \"look over his shoulder\" while he is at work. JLG never answers. Rejected by the master, the teenager must now find his own way as a filmmaker until that day in 2021 when he senses JLG's end is near. Thomas decides to visit the master. On foot. A pilgrimage to pay his (last) respects. His aim is to meet JLG in person. Thomas Imbach dreams of filming not the master, but WITH the master, for which reason he has packed his Aaton camera in his backpack. The closer he gets to Lake Geneva, the more intense his emotions, his anxiety, his uncertainty. SAY GOD BYE is the story of an obsession; it is also a story about the universal theme of love. It is the story of a man who finally summons the courage to seek out his beloved, to tell him face to face about his lifelong love and to say, \u201cThank you, JLG\u201d",

The father\u2019s voice, in the present tense, accompanies the recordings of the devastation but, little by little, the two narratives, visual and audio, subtly begin to diverge. The film weaves itself into this discrepancy, like an essay on memory and archive, on memory as the incomplete process of recreation, on the surprising wild flowers emerging among the ruins of the past.",

You see, Selenge is the sensitive, artistic type and the city\u2019s hustle and bustle can quickly overwhelm her finely tuned senses. That\u2019s why her loving husband Erkhme decided that the peace and quiet of the countryside might do her some good. He\u2019s definitely the caring type, but he does have a bit of an authoritarian streak. For example, he serves her homemade soup but forces her to swallow pills \u2013 supposedly tranquillizers to calm her nerves \u2013 along with it. She\u2019s also got some suspicious bruises on her body and at night she has some of the most vivid, THE SHINING-ish nightmares about her significant other. And now she\u2019s all alone with him in a cabin in the wilderness? Well, not quite alone. There\u2019s one neighbor and luckily, he\u2019s the friendly, nosy type that likes to sit on his porch observing the new residents next door. And he does not like what he sees\u2026 Before opting for the director\u2019s chair, Bataar Batsukh was a cinematographer on several Mongolian action flicks and it\u2019s clear he carried all of his experience \u2013 as well as his love for Daren Aronofsky, to whom he dedicates this film \u2013 over to his first feature. ABERRANCE is kinetic, visually striking and above all original and daring. Its extremely diverse stylistic pallet (painterly strokes of lightning, breath-taking night scenes, color filters, unusual camera angles and compositions, Steadicam mounted onto characters as they fall, crash or fight, etc.) and numerous twists quickly overwhelmed all of our senses. But we know better now than to go calm our nerves in a cabin in the Mongolian woods\u2026",

In the storm of her own emotions, mixed with guilt, anger, fear and hope, love is what teaches Els to try stepping forward even if it seems impossible. She meets with her daughter once per week, continuously trying to create distance between herself and her daughter on the purpose of continuing her own life as an independent human being and a woman in love. While she is waiting for the decision about the euthanasia from her daughter's psychiatric team and tries to accept her will, she still hopes that her daughter will change her mind. Falling is a lyrical, found footage-based testimony from a mother who faces not only the taboos surrounding motherhood, but also the most difficult situation in her life.",

She makes it clear that, during her relationship with the very young Bob Dylan, she used her celebrity to launch his career. Her disappointment at her later estrangement from him becomes palpable.",

Nevertheless, the films were carefully framed, edited, and manipulated to induce a transformation and provoke the development of a new society.\r\n\r\nThis film revisits the remains of the Automeris Project and recreates one such film made using the few remaining assembly notes",

The music video shows dance moments from children's films of the 70s and 80s of the twentieth century. They are illusions of a carefree time, time of adventures, fantasy journeys and freedom. The Palestinian-Syrian multi-instrumentalist, composer and producer Momen Shaweesh brings together the traditional playing of the oriental instruments oud and kanun with techno bests and sounds of the New Wave in a peculiar characteristic style. The video sequences together with the music result in a video essay about a time gone by. The appropriation of the footage serves to reclaim the shared childhood of the two countries. In an act of collective memory, the video invites the audience to seek their own experiences in these images.",

The global reality of state of emergencies penetrated everything we had taken for granted, and the era made many people take stock of their lives in a new light. What happened to us and what is the future we want to be heading to? As the virus controls the world, schoolchildren start collecting letters to be encapsulated in a wooden chest built by the students, to be opened in more than 50 years. The documentary is a time capsule in itself.",

This ominous exterior stands in contrast to the warmer colour scheme of the apartments where the film\u2019s protagonists spend their time. The three women share similarly traumatising experiences of violence in Jordan; they allude to rape, assault, detention as they speak. In their apartments, they seek refuge from the violence of the outside world.\r\nHelin \u00c7elik does not tell these women\u2019s stories, but rather sketches their post-traumatic situation in impressive, poetic film imagery. Raquel Fern\u00e1ndez N\u00fa\u00f1ez\u2019s camera shows their bodies in extreme close-ups: eye sockets marked by insomnia, trembling hands. Their traumas also reveal disturbing thoughts, such as one protagonist\u2019s idea to kill her children to protect them. At the same time, she is seen interacting with them lovingly. ANQA shows how these women struggle not to allow the suffering they have experienced to define them. \u201cI am not the remains,\u201d one of them says. \u201cI exist.\u201d",

    "synopsis": "A GOLDEN LIFE is a documentary filmed at a gold mine in southern Burkina Faso. Teenage boy Rasman\u00e9 and his peers work daily from morning until night in the mines. Without safety clothing and under the most precarious of conditions, they work 100 metres underground to the point of exhaustion, armed with nothing but pickaxes to get to the much-longed-for gold. The fact that they are minors is of no concern. They are simply left to their own devices, relying entirely on themselves to extract the gold if they want to get paid for their labour. We get a detailed impression of how the mines work, how they operate on a day-to-day basis and the constant risks involved. The camera never feels voyeuristic; it mostly stays with Rasman\u00e9 and tries to capture his emotions as he goes about his business and communicates to the various supervisors on site. In his rare moments of leisure, we see him and his colleagues cook, eat together and engage in conversations about themselves, their aspirations, their experiences of growing up and their families. The director creates an incredible rapport with those around him; towards the end of the film, we find out why.",

Examining the complexity and limitations of language as a form of communication \u2013 its ability to both connect and disconnect people \u2013 the filmmaker finds a touching, cinematic voice to express her feelings towards her father.

He gives each boy a category - either love, home, friends, family and location. He asks each of them to find an item that connects themselves, Sid and the word they've been given. They will spend the week building a fire and at the end of the week they'll burn all the items on it, a ritual that Sid believes will make him last forever. \r\n\r\nWithout realising it, it might not be the ritual that will make Sid last forever, but the way in which he has deeply affected those around him in his final months alive.",

References to the first police crime reconstruction, filmed in Liverpool in 1901, are a reminder that addiction has long existed within the fabric of our culture. It\u2019s a tough process and emotionally charged scenes reveal inner truths, which gain additional power when the people playing the roles are, in some sense, playing themselves.

They belong to a gang of small-time crooks who pulled off a major coup during the armed robbery of a Saudi Arabian prince\u2019s car. Their conversation revolves around acquiring a bionic prosthetic hand, a long-cherished dream that the stolen money can make a reality. They don\u2019t yet know that they are being pursued. The tranquillity of the scene stands in stark contrast to the later shootout with cold-blooded killers and establishes a space beyond the genre conventions of the classic gangster film \u2013 as does the stunning performance of a chanson by Breton singer Annkrist at a funeral service at the beginning of the film. The prince\u2019s ecstatic dance to ra\u00ef music in a nightclub, during which his bodyguard fails to notice that he\u2019s being watched, also forms part of this poetics of digression. At the end, when a neighbour who is friends with the gang looks out from his balcony at children and pigeons playing, while the verticals of the banlieue architecture glow in the autumn light, everything is peaceful again.",
